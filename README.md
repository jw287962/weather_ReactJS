# NOTES

## HOW TO USE:

1.  SEARCH FOR LOCATION (OR ACCEPT LOCATION LOOKUP AND IT WILL GRAB YOUR CURRENT LOCATIONS WEATHER DATA)
2.  CLICK THE WEATHER CARD TO GET INDEPTH DETAILS. click Title to return back to home page

## VIA OpenweatherAPI

Current:

- To create working prototype, did the basic api call that accepts CITY LOOKUP (and works with location settings on). (The current CITY lookup APi seems to sometimes call the larger nearby city data instead).
- can add multiple cards each holding a different location to navigate into for more detailsw
- v1.1 Has timer since last refresh, should update every 40 seconds....
- v1.2 Improved location details to include 5 day forecast and 24 hour graph
- v1.3
  - Uses Cookies to remember added location
  - Remove Locations Support

## Future/Improvements:

- Improve API call to allow more specific searches, and to show search results while searching.
- allow caching or some storage of data on computer with the locations the user wants (can delete or add), and will populate with API data upon website load.
- show specific data on the graph when cilcking a point or hovering...?
- add a way so user can change refresh timer based on preferences.

## Reminders

changed some data that is returned

1. dt_txt: is updated to hold {date: 'May 28,2023', time: '4:00 PM'}

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
